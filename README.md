<h1 align="center">Covicare - A comprehensive application for COVID-19 care and record management</h1>

_The primary idea behind the project is to build a comprehensive application, preferably a mobile app to provide an all-encompassing pandemic protection solution for people. The two main aspects of the app are all-in-one care and record management._

---

<br>

> The main objective of this project is to help common people exploit the online services by means of an all-round COVID-19 care solution easily and effectively in this era of digital revolution.

<br>

The users have the option to register themselves on the app and existing users can login using their credentials. When logged in, the user can access four main features, namely:

1. **Statistics** - Shows global and country-wise case details divided into Confirmed, Recovered, Active & Death types in an user-friendly manner.
2. **Check symptoms** - Allows users to check their symptoms and get an intelligent recommendation on steps to be taken (precautionary care, visit a doctor, etc.)
3. **Book appointment** - Allows users to make appointments to visit a doctor or get bookings for the COVID-19 test depending on availability of slots.
4. **Reports** - Provides users with their COVID-19 test reports sent directly through the app.

<br>

- The frontend of the project is built using `Flutter` to deliver a mobile application for Android which provides a whole host of functionalitieas to the users.

- The `Firebase` realtime database has been used for storage and retrieval of data, and for backend activities like pushing the test reports, etc.

- The `Covid19API` API has been used for fetching the global and country-wise case details in real-time.
